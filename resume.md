## Experience
### Shutterstock - Principal Engineer (02.2021 - present)

Shutterstock is the largest provider of stock photos in the world, along with video, music and 3d models. I was responsible along with my team for maintaining, overseeing and improving Shutterstock's complex stack, with an emphaisis on 3D content. 
Highlights include:

- Performed full integration of 3D infrastructure into Shutterstock's existing infrastructure while standardizing CI/CD on
Github Actons, ArgoCD and Helm. This involved around 350 repositories moving from github.com to the enterprise github,
and replacement of a bespoke Hubot application deployment system with ArgoCD, GHA and Helm. This same migration also involved moving from secrets stored in zookeeper to a GHA -> Amazon Secrets Manager -> k8s external secrets pipeline.
- Continued to oversee and enhance our 3d workflow application running in a hybrid AWS/on-premises environment.
- Oversaw move of Shutterstock's logging system from SumoLogic to Newrelic. At 4TB/day, of log ingestion, This
dropped logging costs by 80% while increasing observability.
- Rapid post-acquisition migration complex Turbosquid stack from on-premises Kubernetes to Amazon EKS while transferring on-premises PostgreSQL to AWS Aurora and on-premises Elasticsearch to OpenSearch. Also managed the migration of Redis and Memcached. This was done with minimun downtime (around 15 minutes).
